This folder consists of four files:

  i. CalculateMinCostPath.java : This file contains the path move functions to move along the 2-d array while calculating 
                                 the min-cost path to reach the specified destination from (0,0).
                                 
  ii. Indices.java : This file contains the data structure to store the index in the format of (x,y)
  
  iii. main.java : This file contains the main driver function which contains the 2-d cost array and the destination. In 
                   this function we also call the min-cost path calculating function.
  iv. Traverselist.java : This contains the custom arraylist to store the indices already traversed to avoid repetition of cells.
