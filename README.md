Hi, this git repository of the codes I created during the period of Jun 2020 -Aug 2020 for the purpose of completion of internship at CodeSpeedy Pvt. Lmt.


The repository consists of solutions of total of 10 tasks  as :

First Task: To make a program to find the minimum cost path where you can move up, down, left and right.
            This is achieved by making 
            1) a class to store the indices of a cell in the 2D matrix,
            2) an arraylist to store the indices of the cells traversed,
            3) a function class to store the functions used to complete the task,
            4) and a main driver function to c begin the task.
            
Second Task: To make a program to left rotate an array of size N by d places.

Third Task: To make the program to check if a given number can be displayed with a given number of seven segment leds.

Fourth Task: To display the nth line of the Pascal Triangle.

Fifth Task: To make a program to convert an array to list and a list to array.

Sixth Task: To make a program to convert a singly linked list to circular linked list and a circular linked list to singly linked list.

Seventh Task: To make a program to find the GCD of the given range in an array.

Eighth Task: To make a program to find the smallest sub-array in an array that matches a given GCD.

Ninth Task: To make a program to find the minimum and maximum value in a given range in an array.

Tenth Task: To make a program to solve the bin packing fraction with the help of using
