This is the program to complete the task of left rotating the array by d places.

This is achieved by simply analysing the border conditions, in other words, the index that belong to the 
condtion 0 <= i < n.

Since in these indexes the values could not just be shifted left but have to placed at the indexes in the\
range (n-d) <= i < n.
